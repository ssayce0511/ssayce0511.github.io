My name is Sarah Sayce. I'm from Pinehurst, North Carolina and a senior finishing my last semester at the College of Charleston. I am a Computer Information Systems major and a Data Science minor. I am excited to be in this class and collaborate on an open sourced project.

My academic interests include reommendation systems, AI & machine learning, and natural language processing. When I'm not working I love being outdoors & picking up different activities. 

### Future Plans

This summer I plan on starting as a Software Consultant at Capgemini in Dallas, Texas.
