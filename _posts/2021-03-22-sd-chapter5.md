title: Client Centered Software Development
subtitle: Chapter 5 Reflection 
---

Chapter 5 of Client-Centered Software Development revolves around Domain Class Development. This involes finding and resuing code from earlier open source projects and coding some classes from scratch. This chapter also covers unit testing principles. 
## Coding Domain Classes
### Reusing External Legacy Code 
Some domain classes are so common that they reoccur in many open source projects. Person class is an example. New CO-FOSS projects should first look outside its own omain for similarly well devloped solutions that fit its needs. 

### Reusing Internal Legacy Code 
Many Co-FOSS projecs involve upgrading existing open source products to meet additional requirements and fix serious shortcomings in the product. This requires more effort than a standard usability issue. 

### Coding Domain Classes from Scratch 
Most domain classes aren't as straightforeward as sugessted. In realit ymost domain classes are unique to that application. More likely these domain classes will be coming from within the same organization. 

### Adding Functionality with Constructors and Getters
Not all functions in a new class can be predicted but it is safe to include a constructor for anew object in a class and a series of so called getter functions for each instance variable. 

## Software Testing 
Do not wait until the end of development to test. This must be integrated into the development process and done throughout the coding process. Test driven development places requirements gathering ahead of development. This code will be refined as we go on.
