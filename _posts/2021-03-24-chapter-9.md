### Chapter 7
Chapter 7 revolves around User Interface Design. It is important to recognize that the user interface is where all discussions begin and end. It is how developers and users see and report bugs and issues to each other. Integrity and usability are established and maintained here. While there are many methods of UI design, the general guidelines include: 
+ Task Oriented - each use case can be explained and a mapping of steps between pages can be made 
+ Language - The languge is consistent with the domain and familiar to the user 
+ Simplicity
+ Navigatability 
+ Visual consistency 
+ Discoverability - Can all the pages be found? 
+ Data integrity - discussed in a previous chapter 
+ Client-Server Integrity 
+ Security
+ Documentation 

#### MVC Pattern
The Model View Control pattern is used to organize UI and program files. 
+ Model - this includes database connections & application data
+ View - This is the front facing html and accompanying interface for the user 
+ Controller - controls user input, output and navigation 

This chapter also covered how to prevent different security risks including SQl injection attacks and corss site scripting attacks. Responsive user interfaces are also covered. The design process for these responsive UI's is more complex and layered than traditional web based projects since this is more likely to be on a mobile device or used "in the field".
