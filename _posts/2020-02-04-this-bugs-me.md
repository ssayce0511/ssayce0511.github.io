After reading chapter 6 of [Teaching Open Source](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-Exercise_-_Find_the_Oldest_Bug.html) I applied some of the exercises related to bug searching on our team's FOSS project, Zulip. The repository for zulip can be found [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip). 

### EX. 6.4 Find the oldest bug that's still open in your chosen project. Write a blog entry describing the problem, with a theory about why the bug hasn't been resolved yet. (Bonus points if you can actually resolve the bug.)

### EX. 6.5 Figure out how to create a new account on the bug tracker of your chosen project. You'll need that account very soon.

### EX. 6.6 Go through your project's bug tracker and find a bug that you think you might be able to reproduce -- and then try to reproduce it in the latest build. Take careful notes. Report your experiences as a comment to the bug. If you can reproduce the bug, great! Give as much information as you can. If you can't reproduce the bug, great! Give as much information as you can, and ask the original reporter if there are other steps you might be able to take to reproduce the bug.

### EX. 6.7 Find five bug reports in the new state, and attempt to triage them according to the rules above. Your goal is to do as much as you possibly can, in a short period of time, to make those bug reports as useful as possible to the developer to whom they are assigned. (Note: be sure to follow any triage rules that your project may have defined. If there are no set triage rules, be sure to announce your intentions on the project's mailing list, so that developers can provide you some guidelines if they choose.)
