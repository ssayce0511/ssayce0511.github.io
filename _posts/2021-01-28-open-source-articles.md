For this blog post, I read two articles from [this website](https://opensource.com/article/20/12/containers-101) and will share what I learned and my reflections on the articles. 

## 6 Container concepts you need to know 

This article summarized what containers were, which is something I'm not totally familar with. Containers are similar to VM's, and currently they are being used as a complementary system to VM's rather than a competitor. Essentially, a container is an application bundle of lightweight components, such as application dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, that run in an isolated environment on top of traditional operating systems or in virtualized environments for easy portability and flexibility.

The figure above shows the structure of a container. 

Containers have their advantages, they are more flexible than VM's. They also create a common set of building blocks that can be reused in development at any stage so you can re-create environments for deployment. Docker revolutionized containers and caused them to become more popular. Compared to virtualization, containers make it simpler to achieve flexibility, consistency, and the ability to deploy applications fasterâ€”the main principles of DevOps.

In terms of my personal learning, I wasn't aware of what containers were before reading this article and now I have a better understanding of how they function. I am familiar with VMs and have used them before and I had heard of Docker but never really knew what was going on. This article summarized all the necessary information.
