For this blog post, I read two articles from [this website](https://opensource.com/article/20/12/containers-101) and will share what I learned and my reflections on the articles. 

## 6 Container concepts you need to know 

This article summarized what containers were, which is something I'm not totally familar with. Containers are similar to VM's, and currently they are being used as a complementary system to VM's rather than a competitor. Essentially, a container is an application bundle of lightweight components, such as application dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, that run in an isolated environment on top of traditional operating systems or in virtualized environments for easy portability and flexibility.
